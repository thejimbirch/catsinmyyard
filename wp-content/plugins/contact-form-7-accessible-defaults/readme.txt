Replaces the default Contact Form 7 form with an accessible equivalent and provides a suite of selectable base forms. 

== Description ==

= How to use this plug-in: =

If you install and activate this plug-in before installing Contact Form 7, the default form created by Contact Form 7 will be accessible. If you've already installed Contact Form 7, you'll want to delete the default form and create new forms using the templates available in this plug-in.

= Use Contact Form 7 with an accessible default form =

This plug-in replaces the default template that Contact Form 7 automatically generates with an accessible equivalent of that form and adds a suite of additional basic form types that you can choose from to model your new forms.

The plug-in doesn't change anything about forms that have already been built with Contact Form 7. The structure of Contact Form 7 is such that it isn't possible for the plug-in to rewrite existing forms for improved accessibility, but it *is* possible to make sure that the base you have for starting a form is accessible.

Contact Form 7 is actually a very accessible plug-in. It has an accessible back-end, and if you create the right template, the front-end form will have great accessibility. 

But the default form is not accessible. Not at all, in fact - it's missing some of the most basic elements of accessibility: form labels. This plug-in supplies a new default form that includes everything you need to make your default form accessible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this fix all my Contact Form 7 forms? =

Nope. All this does is change Contact Form 7 so that the default form it generates is accessible. This gives you a model for what an accessible form should look like in Contact Form 7 (with appropriately associated labels and IDs, and with the response moved to the top of the form.), but does nothing at all to change how Contact Form 7 behaves. 

= Why aren't there demos for all types of fields? =

Two reasons. First, with the current version of Contact Form 7 it's not possible to make the quiz input type accessible. I've already reported this to the plug-in author, and it will be updated soon. Second, because I haven't had time to create forms that use every possible field. If you've got another example you'd like to see in a basic form, let me know!
